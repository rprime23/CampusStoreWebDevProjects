This is a group of projects from when I worked at the University of Utah Campus Store.

PLEASE NOTE
- We used NetSuite SuiteCommerce Advanced and their built in CMS system which included themes that helped make the site cohesive. The themes are where colors were set, fonts were set, etc. As such when running the code the colors, fonts, etc. may not be exactly the same as any included screenshots. This also made changing certain behaviors difficult, which led to the use of some very specific CSS identifiers in order to override themes in some cases.
- NetSuite also had a default width for its content CMS_HTML block. So any code that is 100% width when outside of netsuite was not necessarily 100% on the web page itself.
