We used NetSuite SuiteCommerce Advanced's built in CMS for our content management system. In general, sites that use NetSuite are very slow. As a result we were instructed not to use JavaScript. For this page we would manually comment and uncomment items then push those changes on the appropriate dates. For the JavaScript version please see the Calendar with JavaScript folder within the Holiday Calendar folder.
