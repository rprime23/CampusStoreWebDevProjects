Please note that there were issues with refreshing NetSuite's cart button, but the item does get added. V1 adds but the user would have to manually refresh the page. V2 refreshes the page.

This function mimicks AJAX style functionality by using NetSuite behavior and links to add an item to cart in the background of the page while still giving the user feedback of an item being added.
